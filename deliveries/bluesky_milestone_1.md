**The invoice has been send out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/smart-contract-bounty/Support-Docs/blob/master/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:**, please provide a link to the merged contract from the running buonty (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/smart-contract-bounty/Wasm-Bounty-01/tree/master/applications) directory).

[Bluesky project]()

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

In this [technical showcase]() we implemented with ink! smart contract language including custom macros, security, testing scripts, deployment and documents. It delivers the first milestone: define a specific use case [Order Food on Blockchain](), implement in ink! with macros encapsulating reusable business logic, tested and deployed, then publish article to share with the community learning experiences / resources / recommendations about ink! and openBrush. 

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

* [FoodOrder open source github repo]()

The project delivers part 1, fully open sourced and [documented]() with Apache 2.0 license, to share with both web2 and web3 developer communities. This is the first of a three parts post covering the use case, ink! implementation with macros. For [next steps](), the upcoming part 2 on upgradability, and part3 to benchmark the performance, quantify binary footprints and optimize gas costs in various ink! optimization variations.
